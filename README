ticket - script to support the "spontaneous branch" workflow in darcs.

The ticket script has three subcommands:

	ticket new - set the current ticket name
	ticket current - display the current ticket name
	ticket record - record a new patch with the current ticket prepended.

To install, simply copy the ticket script to a directory in your PATH. Requires Perl 5.10, because it's frickin' 2010 already.

This script is free software, available under the same terms as Perl itself.
